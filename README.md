
# Introduction

The goal of this project is to show you my learning steps towards passing the AWS Solutions Architect certification exam.

First of all, as I always say, the important thing here is not the certification itself, but the learning process and the knowledge acquired. 

## Training steps

Basically my training has consisted in the following parts:

1. Completing the Udemy course
2. Creating a written summary from the summary videos of every section (you can find it [here](course-summary.md))
3. Practicing every in the AWS console
5. Creating a demo proyect for the VPC section
6. Reading Amazon S3 and ELB F.A.Q's
